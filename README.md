# 🥷 DeFi Dojo: Smart Contract Security Projects & Challenges

DeFi Dojo is a curated collection of exploit labs, challenge writeups, and smart contract auditing exercises built to showcase deep understanding of Ethereum security.
 designed to help developers, auditors, and DeFi security enthusiasts hone their skills in:

- 🧠 **Vulnerability discovery**
- 🛡️ **Offensive & defensive smart contract design**
- 🧪 **Test-driven exploit development**
- 🐍 **Python-based attack automation**
- 🔍 **Audit-grade analysis and reasoning**
---
### ✅ Highlights

- 🔍 Technical blog-style breakdowns of real vulnerabilities  
- 🧠 Curated Ethernaut challenge solutions with automated `web3.py` test suites  
- 🧪 Focus on proxy patterns, reentrancy, low-level calls, and AMM exploits  
- 🐍 **Python exploit script** that solves it programmatically
- 🚧 Coming soon: Original CTF-style DeFi challenges based on real-world incidents

### 📁 Structure

- `ethernaut/` — handpicked Ethernaut levels with high-value exploits
- `dojo_test_utils.py` — web3 test utilities used across levels
- `contracts/` — custom Solidity contracts and interfaces (for later challenges)
---
### ✅ Skills You'll Develop

- Reentrancy, delegatecall abuse, fallback misuses, tx.origin auth flaws
- Upgradeable proxy issues, integer overflows, front-running
- Composable attack logic using Python & Solidity
---
### 🧠 Requirements

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)
- [Anvil (local chain)]
- Python 3.10+
- `web3.py`, `python-dotenv`, `py-solc-x`
---
### 💡 Why This Exists

This repo is built by an **experienced backend engineer** transitioning into **smart contract security**.

Inspired by:
- [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/)
