# üß™ Level 22: Dex

> **Category**: Token Swaps / Price Manipulation / Broken Invariants  
> **Difficulty**: Medium  
> **Objective**: Drain all of *at least one* of the two ERC20 tokens from the DEX contract and exploit its flawed swap logic.

## üîç Challenge Overview

This challenge simulates a vulnerable decentralized exchange (DEX) contract with two swappable tokens. The DEX allows token swaps based on an extremely na√Øve pricing formula. Your goal is to drain all of one token from the DEX and leave it with a zero balance, using only the provided swap functionality.

---
## üß† Vulnerability Explained

The DEX contract implements a basic token-swapping mechanism between two tokens. However, its price calculation is insecure and manipulable.
```solidity
function getSwapPrice(address from, address to, uint amount) public view returns (uint) {
    return ((amount * balanceOf(to)) / balanceOf(from));
}
```
The flaw lies in its naive pricing formula:
- No constant product invariant (x * y = k) like Uniswap
- Prone to manipulation due to integer division
- Allows swaps to skew price ratios dramatically

Let‚Äôs say, You have 10 token1 and 10 token2 and DEX has 100 token1 and 100 token2.

If you start swapping back and forth ‚Äî always giving just enough to take more ‚Äî the price swings in your favor over time.

Example swap:
```text
swapAmount = amount * to_balance / from_balance
```
With each swap, from_balance increases, to_balance decreases ‚Üí next swap gets you more.

## üìâ Exploit Strategy
The attacker has 10 of each token initially. The DEX has 100 of each. You are allowed to approve and call swap(from, to, amount) repeatedly.

üß† Key Observations
- Every successful swap changes the pool's balances.
- This alters the price for future swaps.
- Because there's no invariant or minimum output enforcement, price manipulation is trivial.

ü™ì Plan
1. Approve the DEX to spend your tokens.
2. Alternate swapping between Token1 and Token2.
3. Each time, use your full balance to get more of the other token.
4. As prices become more skewed, you extract more value from the pool.
5. Stop when the pool balance of one token hits 0.

## üßæ ERC20 Methods Used
| Method                           | Purpose                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `balanceOf(address)`             | Returns the token balance of a given address.                                |
| `transfer(to, amount)`           | Transfers tokens from `msg.sender` to another address.                       |
| `transferFrom(from, to, amount)` | Transfers tokens from one address to another, using allowance mechanism.     |
| `approve(spender, amount)`       | Grants another address (`spender`) permission to spend tokens.               |
| `allowance(owner, spender)`      | Returns remaining tokens `spender` is allowed to spend on behalf of `owner`. |

In this level, transferFrom was heavily used inside the Dex contract to pull tokens in and push tokens out during swaps.
We manually called approve() from our account to allow the DEX contract to spend our tokens on our behalf.

## üß† Key Takeaways
- Integer division in Solidity truncates decimals. Use SafeMath or fixed-point libraries in production.
- A DEX without slippage control is easily manipulable.
- Always sanity check pricing logic when building financial primitives.
- Testing price-impact exploits doesn't always require complex contracts ‚Äî web3.py is enough!
---
### üõ°Ô∏è Defense Recommendations
- Never calculate price based on reserves only. Use a proper invariant like x * y = k.
- Add slippage limits or minimum output checks to prevent drain-through-manipulation.
- Enforce fees to disincentivize repeated round-trip swaps.
- Follow best practices from established AMMs like Uniswap v2/v3.
